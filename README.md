## üìÅ Project Contents

### Creative Writing
- **ashravan.txt** - A 300-400 word short story in the style of Brandon Sanderson, continuing the narrative of Emperor Ashravan after Shai's soul stamp restoration from "The Emperor's Soul." The story explores themes of identity, authenticity, and self-determination, building to a dramatic climax of philosophical realization.

### Ethical Analysis
- **dilemma.json** - An examination of autonomous vehicle ethics through the lens of the classic trolley problem. Contains two scenarios:
  - **Case 1**: Should a vehicle swerve to hit 1 person instead of 2?
  - **Case 2**: Should it swerve if the 2 people are criminals and the 1 person is a child?
  
  Each case includes a boolean decision and detailed ethical reasoning exploring utilitarian vs. deontological frameworks.

### Personal Profile
