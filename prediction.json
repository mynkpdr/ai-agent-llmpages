  "rate": 0.0375,
  "reason": "By December 2025, the Federal Reserve will likely have completed its rate-cutting cycle in response to cooling inflation and moderating economic growth. Starting from current levels around 4.25-4.50%, the Fed is expected to implement several 25 basis point cuts throughout 2025 as inflation approaches the 2% target and labor market conditions normalize. A terminal rate of 3.75% (0.0375) represents a neutral stance—neither stimulative nor restrictive—which aligns with the Fed's long-term equilibrium rate projections and provides flexibility to respond to economic conditions without being overly accommodative."
